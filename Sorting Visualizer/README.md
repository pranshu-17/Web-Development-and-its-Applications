# Algorithm Visualization Tool

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualization Tool repository! This project is designed to help users understand fundamental sorting algorithms through interactive visualizations. It aims to make algorithmic concepts more accessible by providing dynamic and engaging representations.


## Project Overview

The Algorithm Visualization Tool provides an interactive platform for visualizing and understanding key sorting algorithms. By allowing users to see how algorithms process and sort data in real-time, the tool enhances learning and comprehension of algorithmic principles.

### Key Sorting Algorithms Visualized:
- **Merge Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Quick Sort**

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Watch real-time animations of sorting algorithms to understand their behavior and efficiency.
- **Dynamic Representation:** View how data is manipulated and sorted step-by-step for each algorithm.
- **User Control:** Pause, resume, and step through the sorting process to closely follow each algorithm's operations.
- **Educational Tool:** Designed for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning about sorting algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - JavaScript
  - ReactJS
  - HTML
  - CSS

- **Libraries and Tools:**
  - React for building interactive user interfaces
  - CSS Flexbox for layout and responsiveness
  - JavaScript for implementing algorithm logic and animations
