# Web Development and Its Applications

Welcome to the repository for my self-driven projects in web development. This repository contains two primary projects: a responsive portfolio website and a comprehensive algorithm visualization tool. These projects were developed between June 2024 and August 2024 and showcase my skills in web development and algorithm visualization.

## Project Overview

### Responsive Portfolio Website

**Description:**  
Designed and implemented a modern, responsive portfolio website to display personal projects and achievements. The website serves as a professional online presence, highlighting key skills and accomplishments.

**Technologies Used:**
